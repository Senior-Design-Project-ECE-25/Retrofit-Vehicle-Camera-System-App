To combat this, we have designed a solution that will stream to your phone from a camera placed at the back of a car. This is intended to be a cheaper solution to having rearview cameras capabilities, without the need to purchase a new vehicle."

        "body": "To create a rearview camera app for cars that do not have them. With the increase in new cars having rearview cameras, older cars will be behind in terms of safety for owners. The problem is that buying a new car is expensive, new cars go for tens of thousands of dollars and not everyone can afford something that expensive, even if they want to be in a safer car."
