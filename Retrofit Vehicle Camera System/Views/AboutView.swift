To combat this, we have designed a solution that will stream to your phone from a camera placed at the back of a car. This is intended to be a cheaper solution to having rearview cameras capabilities, without the need to purchase a new vehicle.")

With the increase in new cars having rearview cameras, older cars will be behind in terms of safety for owners. The problem is that buying a new car is expensive, new cars go for tens of thousands of dollars and not everyone can afford something that expensive, even if they want to be in a safer car.")

This is done by placing a camera at the back of a car and having the output of that camera stream to the userâ€™s phone.")
